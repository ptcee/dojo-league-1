# Rules
Holding a home zone: 1 point.
Holding an enemy zone: 2 points.

If you are defending a zone in your home area, you may choose which player recieves priority.

You cannot challenge the same person twice in a row.

• Starting from the bottom ranked player, each player may declare an attack on a zone, wagering one of their own zones if defeated.
• If you control no zones to wager, you may attack an uncontested zone. Choose an opponent, whoever wins claims the zone.
• If there are no uncontested zones, you may declare an attack on a zone, but your opponent chooses priority.

If a baron does not attack a zone 2 weeks in a row, one of their zones will randomly become uncontested.
